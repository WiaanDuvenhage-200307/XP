<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be downloaded from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAjwuYWSBhByEiwAKd_n_q4WXi5vcCji08peoWOEsv-KHFT7QWNZNmozB_CIiiSNl_HOUL-1JBoCGx8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/WiaanDuvenhage-200307/XP.git
```
2. Open the project

Use `File` : `Open` in Android Studio.

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->

## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->

### Entering your username

### Show & Reset High Score
![image6][image6]
The user can view their high score as well as reset it in the settings page

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

I am a very huge fan of dark theme applications and using colors that contrast extremely well, so in conclusion I thought it was a no-brainer to use in black, white and red in conjunction with each other to create the most eye-catching application. By looking at my wireframes you would notice that my answering method differs from the final application outcome. I have come to realise how intricate and dense Kotlin can be so decided to go with a more simpler, yet effective answering method.

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

### Implementation Process

- For the entirety of the project, I have used <b>Kotlin 1.7.0</b> for the functionality and I used <b>XML</b> for the front-end of the application.

#### XML

- I implemented `ScrollView` for my <b>Settings</b> & <b> 

#### Kotlin
- I incorporated `tailwindcss` to create and style my calendar component the way I wanted it to look

- `axios` was implemented so that I can make HTTP requests to the database server so that I can retrieve and push data to it

- I used `PHPMyAdmin` to alter data on the database and used PHP to talk to the backend MySQL database



#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- A highlight of this project was defintely interacting with the database and manipulating data on the database and seeing it being displaye on the application.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- I struggled to get all my updates and deletes to be implemented.
- I struggled to get all my profile pictures to be updated and rendered on the DOM from the Database.
- debugging the CORS error's for sending data to the Database, especially my Register page's CORS error
- I struggled a lot with debugging the PHP error's
- Front-end was also a bit tricky because I kept following the trend of putting everything in blocks

#### Above And Beyond

<!-- TODO Change this! -->

The aspects I learned outside of this class, is that I implemented tailwindcss to create my calendar, I also incorporated the Date-fns dependency to render my calendar dates.

### Future Implementation

<!-- TODO Change this! -->

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I want to complete all my update and delete's of the patients and doctor's
- I want to fix my styling for my application
- I want to display the appointments by week
- I want to complete the profile pictures to be rendered and updated

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
